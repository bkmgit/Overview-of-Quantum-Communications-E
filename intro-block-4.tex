Given an entangled Bell pair, we know how to teleport a qubit, and we know how to manage errors via error detection (purification) and error correction (QEC).  We know how photons behave in waveguides such as optical fibers.  And, having studied some of the applications of distributed entanglement, we know a little about why we want to build quantum networks.
Now, it is time to reach for distance. First, we discuss some of the key ideas behind and requirements for long distance communication.  Achieving this long distance communication in the quantum realm requires the use \emph{quantum repeaters}, the central technology in this book. After introducing the concepts of repeaters, this lesson block concludes with a look at the technological building blocks used.
